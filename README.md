# Coding Exercise

Welcome to Coding stage of Smartly Interview Process!

This stage will assess your coding skills, algorithmic thinking, data structures knowledge along with communication and problem solving skills. The exercise consists of up to 3 levels for a given problem. Expected coding time is 60 minutes.

## How to Start

1. Clone this repository to a local folder
2. Navigate to [the first problem](problem-movement/README.md) and read the requirements
3. Implement the correct solution and proceed to the next part of the problem

## F.A.Q.

### Which language can I use?

Any procedural or alike language: C++, C#, Java, PHP or even Scala (unless it doesn't go too much into FP territory as we don't use it much in Smartly).

### Can I refer to documentation? Google search?

Absolutely, we do that in real work too.

### What about Co-Pilot or ChatGPT?

If it's in your toolkit - go ahead, but be ready to explain what specific lines of code do, side effects and drawbacks. In Smartly we don't use Co-Pilot and ChatGPT at the moment, be ready to demonstrate your skill that's closer to real work application during the exercise.
